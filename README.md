This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Libraries used and Approach

The development was pretty straighforward:
* For the design, I installed ant desgin and used their layout for the dashboard, which is very convenient for fast navigation. Ant design is the second most popular design component framework for react
* For the charts, I installed chart js and react chart js to define the chart types required.
* For making request to the backend, I used axios and created a requestHandler function to handle the communication.
